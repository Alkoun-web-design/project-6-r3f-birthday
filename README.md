# React Three Fiber / Vite

This project was originally developed in September 2023 for sending birthday wishes to someone. Its first implementation was filled with oversized .glb files, which resulted in large and untenable loading times.

The project was found again in August 2025, and the scene was completely reworked to use minimal resources, including smaller .glb files, and less models.

Overall the change of the scene had to be considered as the initial scene was the inside of a cafe with people inside a birthday celebration taking place. Through the window, another building could be seen across the street. This used up plenty of resources, and the loading times were unwieldly.

The reworked scene takes a top-down view and watches as a table surrounded by chairs is holding the birthday cake, plates, and coffee cups of the guests. The table is surrounded by balloons animated to move around.

Further improvements can and will take place.
